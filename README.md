# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `redux-persist` allows us to persist our reducer values

### `redux-thunk` is one flavour of asynchronous side effects inside of Redux.

It means that we allow our application to fire actions and those actions need not have to flow through the redux diagram in a synchronous manner. Instead we get redux bindings which means we can read from the store, dispatch new actions in the middleware section of Redux flow. 

Redux Thunk is a middleware and it allows us to receive actions in the form of functions. So now we have some asynchronous action , so instead of dispatching an action in typical format with type and payload, instead we pass a function. The function goes to Redux Thunk and Redux Thunk takes this function and it passes into it a dispatch, this dispatch is the same dispatch that we have used in redux until this point. So we can dispatch new actions right inside of redux thunk. This new action will move back into the flow and it might hit another thunk or it might continue onto the redux store and further reducers. Through thunks we can abstract out the logic into Thunks themselves.
